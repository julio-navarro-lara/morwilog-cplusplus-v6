# Morwilog C++ v6

C++ version of Morwilog, presented in my PhD thesis.

## Context

This is the frist complete version of Morwilog, an ACO-based algorithm for attack identification and detection presented in my PhD Thesis "Modelization and identification of multi-step cyberattacks in sets of events". [Link to the PhD thesis manuscript](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02315999/document).

There is more information about the algorithm in section 6.1 (pages 136-152).

## Dependencies

The program uses Boost (https://www.boost.org/)

## Anknowledgement

I thank David Hazekamp and Clint Sharp, creators of Splunk Event Generator (eventgen), a utility allows to build real-time event generators. I modified their code to adapt it to the needs of my experiments with Morwilog. The modified code is also uploaded in this repository.
